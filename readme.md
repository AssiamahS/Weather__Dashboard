## Author: [Your Name]

## Description

This weather dashboard allows users to search for cities and view the current weather conditions as well as a 5-day forecast. It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data based on user input. The dashboard dynamically updates HTML and CSS to display the retrieved weather information. Users can also view their search history, which is stored locally using localStorage.
